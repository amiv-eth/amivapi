AMIV API is a Python-EVE based REST interface to manage members, events, mail forwards, job offers and study documents for a student organisation. It was created by AMIV an der ETH to restructure the existing IT infrastructure. If you are not from AMIV and think this is useful feel free to fork and modify.

## Deploy using Docker

AMIV API is available as a [docker](https://www.docker.com) container.
If you do not have mongodb, you can also use docker to quickly start
a database with the default settings used by AMIV API:

```sh
# Create a network s.t. database and api can communicate
docker network create --driver overlay backend
docker service create \
    --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 --network backend\
    -e MONGODB_DATABASE=amivapi \
    -e MONGODB_USERNAME=amivapi \
    -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=amivapi \
    bitnami/mongodb
```

Next, create a configuration with (at least) the mongodb credentials and save
it as `amivapi_config.py` (or choose another name).

```python
MONGO_HOST = 'mongodb'  # Use the name of your mongodb service
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_DBNAME = 'amivapi'
MONGO_USERNAME = 'amivapi'
MONGO_PASSWORD = 'amivapi'
```

Finally, create API service and give it access to the config using a docker
secret:

```sh
# Create secret
docker secret create amivapi_config <path/to/amivapi_config.py>

# Create new API service with secret
# Map port 80 (host) to 8080 (container)
docker service create \
    --name amivapi  -p 80:8080 --network backend \
    --secret amivapi_config \
    amiveth/amivapi
```

If you want to use a different name for the secret (or cannot use secrets
and have to mount the config manually), you can use the environment
variable `AMIVAPI_CONFIG` to set the config path in the API container.

## Installation

You need to have mongodb [installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and [running](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/).

You should also use a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Clone and install AMIV API:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amiv-eth/amivapi.git
cd amivapi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will also install amivapi in editable mode (take a look at
`requirements.txt` if you are curious) which allows us to use the command
line interface of amivapi:

```sh
# Run a development server
amivapi run
# Get help, works for sub-commands as well
amivapi --help
amivapi run --help
```

## Running in Production

If you want to use AMIV API properly behind a webserver, e.g. Apache or Nginx
with uwsgi, you need to create a file, e.g. `app.py`, with the following content:

```python
from amivapi import create_app

app = create_app()
```

## Configuration

Now it's time to configure AMIVAPI. Create a file `config.py`
(you can choose any other name as well) with the following content:

```python
# Root password, *definitely* change this!
ROOT_PASSWORD = 'root'

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_HOST = 'localhost'
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_DBNAME = 'amivapi'
MONGO_USERNAME = ''
MONGO_PASSWORD = ''

# Mailing lists for groups (optional, uncomment if needed)
# MAILING_LIST_DIR = '/directory/to/store/mailing/list/files/'
    
# Remote mailings list files via ssh (optional)
# REMOTE_MAILING_LIST_ADDRESS = 'user@remote.host'
# REMOTE_MAILING_LIST_KEYFILE = ''
# REMOTE_MAILING_LIST_DIR = './'

# SMTP configuration for mails sent by AMIVAPI (optional)
# API_MAIL = 'api@amiv.ethz.ch'
# SMTP_SERVER = 'localhost'
# SMTP_PORT = '587'
# SMTP_USERNAME = ''
# SMTP_PASSWORD = ''

# LDAP connection (special LDAP user required, *not* nethz username & password)
# LDAP_USERNAME = ''
# LDAP_PASSWORD = ''
```

AMIV API looks for a configuration in the following order:

1. If using `create_app`, you can name the file explicitly:

   ```python 
   app = create_app(config_file="/path/to/your/config.py")
   ```

2. If no file is specified, you can use the `AMIVAPI_CONFIG` environment
   variable:

   ```sh
   $set AMIVAPI_CONFIG path/to/your/config.py
   ```

3. If no environment variable is specified either, AMIV API checks for a file
   name `config.py` in the current working directory

For `amivapi run` and all other `amivapi` commands you can also specify a
config, see `amivapi <command> --help`, e.g. `amivapi run --help`


## Running The Tests

Create a test user `test_user` with password `test_pw` in the `test_amviapi`
database, which will be used for all tests.

```sh
mongo test_amivapi --eval \
'db.createUser({user:"test_user",pwd:"test_pw",roles:["readWrite"]});'
```

Install the test requirements:

```sh
pip install pytest tox
```
To run all tests:

```sh
tox
```

To run tests based on a keyword:

```sh
tox -- -k <keyword>
```

To run just one python version:

```sh
tox -e py36
```

### Integration Tests

The integration tests for ssh mailing list creation and LDAP require additional
information to be run, which should not be published.
By default, these tests are *skipped*, as you can see in the tox summary.

#### SSH

Set the following environment variables:

- `SSH_TEST_ADDRESS`, e.g. `user@remote.host`
- `SSH_TEST_KEYFILE`(optional): file containing a key that
  is authorized to access the server 
- `SSH_TEST_DIRECTORY`(optional): Directory on remote server where test files
  are stored. Uses  `/tmp/amivapi-test/` by default

#### LDAP

- `LDAP_TEST_USERNAME` and `LDAP_TEST_PASSWORD`
  (*not* your nethz, special LDAP account required)
- `LDAP_TEST_USER_NETHZ` (required to test user import)
  The test will return the imported user data, be sure to verify it
- `LDAP_TEST_USER_PASSWORD` (required to test user login)

Additionally, you need to be inside the ETH network, e.g. using a VPN, otherwise the ETH LDAP server can't be reached. Furthermore be patient,
as the LDAP tests take a little time to complete.
