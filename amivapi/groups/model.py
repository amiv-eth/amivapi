A group is a team within the organization, e.g. the "Vorstand" (board) or
"Kulturteam" (event team).

Groups act as mailing lists, and can grant API permissions to all
[Group Members][1].

<br />

## Moderators and Members

There are two kinds of groups,

- those that allow self enrollment of users,
- and those that do not.

A **user** can only see groups he or she is already a member of and groups
that allow self enrollment. All other groups are hidden.
Furthermore, it is only possible to become a member of a group if self
enrollment is enabled.
Finally, users cannot modify groups in any way.

An **admin** can see all groups, can add any user to any group (this is the
only way to add members to groups that do not allow self enrollment), and can
also update groups.

A group has a **moderator**, specified by the `moderator` field. The moderator
has the same permissions as an admin, but only for the moderated group.
An exception to this are group permissions (see below): These can only be
changed by admins.

<br />

## Mailing Lists

Groups act as mailing lists, so that all members of a group can be reached
quickly.

A group mailing list can receive mail from multiple addresses specified by the
`receive_from` field. This can only be the *local part* of the address
(e.g. `john` instead of `john@smith.com`), as the mail server address cannot
be influenced by the API.

All emails sent to the mailing list are forwarded to

- all members of the group,
- and additional email addresses specified in the `forward_to` field

### Example

| Group          |                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Members        | Pablo (email: `pablo@api.ch`) |
| `receive_from` | `["test"]`                    |
| `forward_to`   | `["backup@external.ch"]`      |

If the mailserver is `api.ch`, the group will receive all mails from
`test@api.ch` and forward them to `backup@external.ch` and `pablo@api.ch`.


<br />

## Permissions

Groups are often tied to certain tasks, e.g. the event team needs to be able to
manage events. Therefore it is possible to add **permissions** to a group, i.e.
grant all group members admin rights for certain API functionality.

There are two kinds of permissions, `read` and `readwrite` (see more [here][2])
and they are granted *per resource*.

In the `permissions` field, you can send an object with the resources as keys
and the respective permissions as values, e.g.

```
{
    "users": "read",
    "sessions": "readwrite"
}
```

(this would grant every member of the group rights to see all users and see
and modify/delete all sessions).

> **IMPORTANT: The most powerful permission**
>
> As group admins are able to modify groups and thereby modify the group
> permissions, they effectively have access to all permissions and are the
> 'true' admins in the API.
>
> Along the same lines, you have to be careful with permissions for
> [API keys][3], as this permission allows to create API keys with arbitrary
> permissions which can be used for subsequent requests.
>
> As a result, **`readwrite` permissions for groups and API keys should only
> be assigned with great care**!
