"""Api group emails.

A email list can be generated for any group.
Everytime a group changes or a groupmember is added/removed, the group mail
files will be regenerated.
(Since we do not get thousands of requests like this per second we don't need
 anything fancy.)

 The files can be created locally or remotely via ssh, to support the current
 mailing list server solution in place.

 Ssh is probably not the best approach for this, but unfortunately the server
 does not support any other type of connection.
 If this changes, this implementation should be updated.
